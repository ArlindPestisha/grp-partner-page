        GRP’s offer to its partners is to improve the impact of public and
        private investment in resilience, advance the case for resilience to
        advocate for change, surface and test resilience innovations, and
        identify opportunities to increase private sector involvement in
        resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        GRP invites organisations that agree GRP’s vision, mission and
        objectives to become partners and to commit to working together to share
        knowledge, identify opportunities around resilience investments,
        highlight effective action, and support GRP.

        underpins the achievement of sustainable development in a rapidly
        changing world are welcome to apply to become a Partner and benefit from
